This app is focused on teaching about Providers and consumers. As well as this, It taught 
us the many uses that they have. As well as this we also learned about adding animations 
to our apps.

    Provider: Provides (dynamic Value) ... May also provide methods to change value
    Consumer: Listens to changes from provider and also activates changes
    Listeners: ensure build method is executed using watch or read

        ConsumerWidget:  allows use of providers in a static way
        Watch: Returns value of provider and rebuilds widget (Use as much as you can instead of Read)
        Read: reads provider without listening to it (AVOID AS MUCH AS YOU CAN)
        .contains = checks if something stores a specific value
        .notifier = obtains state notifier attached to this
